Title: Introduction to Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning <br>
Speaker: Xiaocheng Guo </strong><br>
<br>
Abstract: The problem of searching for patterns in data is a fundamental one and has a long and 
successful history. For instance, the extensive astronomical observations of Tycho 
Brahe in the 16th century allowed Johannes Kepler to discover the empirical laws of 
planetary motion, which in turn provided a springboard for the development of classical mechanics. Similarly, the discovery of regularities in atomic spectra played a 
key role in the development and verification of quantum physics in the early twentieth century. The field of pattern recognition is concerned with the automatic discovery of regularities in data through the use of computer algorithms and with the use of 
these regularities to take actions such as classifying the data into different categories.<br>

Title: Graphical Model in Nutshell<br>
Speaker: Liandong Liu, Zhiyuan Chen, Ruyi Zhao </strong><br>
<br>
Abstract: Probabilistic graphical models are an elegant framework which combines uncertainty (probabilities) and logical structure (independence constraints) to compactly 
represent complex, real-world phenomena. The framework is quite general in that 
many of the commonly proposed statistical models (Kalman filters, hidden Markov 
models, Ising models) can be described as graphical models. Graphical models have 
enjoyed a surge of interest in the last two decades, due both to the flexibility and 
power of the representation and to the increased ability to effectively learn and 
perform inference in large networks.<br>

Title: An Introduction to SVM and Kernel Methods <br>
Speaker: Prof. Qing TAO </strong>(State Key Lab. of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences)<br>
<br>
Abstract: Developed primarily in the neural networks and machine learning literature, the 
radial basis function (RBF) network and the support vector machine (SVM) are 
flexible models for nonlinear discriminant analysis that give good performance on 
a wide range of problems. RBFs are sums of radially symmetric functions; SVMs 
define the basis functions implicitly through the specification of a kernel. <br></td>

<strong>Title: Statistical Network Analysis and Inference: Methods and Applications
 <br>
Speaker: Eric Xing (Assistant Professor of Carnegie Mellon University) </strong><br>
<br>
Abstract: Exploring the statistical properties and hidden characteristics of network entities, and the stochastic processes behind temporal evolution of network topologies, are essential for computational knowledge discovery and prediction based on network data from biology, social sciences and various other fields. In this talk, I first discuss a hierarchical Bayesian framework that combines the mixed membership model and the stochastic blockmodel for inferring latent multi-facet roles of nodes in networks, and for estimating stochastic relationships (i.e., cooperativeness or antagonisms) between roles. Then I discuss a new formalism for modeling network evolution over time based on temporal exponential random graphs, and a MCMC algorithm for posterior inference of the latent time-specific networks. The proposed methodology makes it possible to reverse-engineer the latent sequence of temporally rewiring networks given longitudinal measurements of node attributes, such as intensities of gene expressions or social metrics of actors, even when a single snapshot of such measurement resulted from each (time-specific) network is available. <br>

Title: Communication and Social Interaction
 <br>
Speaker: Tony Bergstrom and Eric Gilbert </strong><br>
<br>
Abstract: Social systems for mediated communication encompasses a wide range of interactions. Email, forums, virtual words, SMS, blogs, and many other frameworks have been built to support social communities and communication. This talk offers a quick glance at a number of Social Spaces projects ranging from how people in rural and urban settings differ in their use of technology, how visualization of activity can be used to reveal patterns in open source communities, and how augmenting collocated interaction with new visual cues can alter perception of conversation. How can computing power be utilized to provide and facilitate and analyze  meaningful interactions. <br>

Title: Opinion Integration Through Semi-supervised Topic Modeling
 <br>
Speaker: Yue Lu </strong><br>
<br>
Abstract: Web 2.0 technology has enabled more and more people to freely express their opinions on the Web, making the Web an extremely valuable source for mining user opinions about all kinds of topics. In this paper we study how to automatically integrate opinions expressed in a well-written expert review with lots of opinions scattering in various sources such as blogspaces and forums. We formally define this new integration problem and propose to use semi-supervised topic models to solve the problem in a principled way. Experiments on integrating opinions about two quite different topics (a product and a political figure) show that the proposed method is effective for both topics and can generate useful aligned integrated opinion summaries. The proposed method is quite general. It can be used to integrate a well written review with opinions in an arbitrary text collection about any topic to potentially support many interesting applications in multiple domains.<br>

<strong>Title: Modeling with Network Regularization
 <br>
Speaker: Qiaozhu Mei</strong><br>
<br>
Abstract: In this paper, we formally define the problem of topic modeling with network structure (TMN). We propose a novel solution to this problem, which regularizes a statistical topic model with a harmonic regularizer based on a graph structure in the data. The proposed method combines topic modeling and social network analysis, and leverages the power of both statistical topic models and discrete regularization. The output of this model can summarize well topics in text, map a topic onto the network, and discover topical communities. With appropriate instantiations of the topic model and the graph-based regularizer, our model can be applied to a wide range of text mining problems such as author-topic analysis, community discovery, and spatial text mining. Empirical experiments on two data sets with different genres show that our approach is effective and outperforms both text-oriented methods and network-oriented methods alone. The proposed model is general; it can be applied to any text collections with a mixture of topics and an associated network structure. <br>

Title: Multidimensional Analysis of Moving Object Data
 <br>
Speaker: Xiaolei Li </strong><br>
<br>
Abstract: The collection of historical or real-time data on moving objects is quickly becoming a ubiquitous task.  With the help of GPS devices, RFID sensors, RADAR, satellites, and other technologies, mobile objects of all sizes, whether it be a tiny cellphone or a giant ocean liner, can be easily tracked around the globe.  Many fundamental problems in the database field have found their parallels in the moving object domain.  They include indexing and query processing of moving objects over static or continuous queries and similarity search between moving objects.  The same has happened with data mining problems as well.  Clustering of moving objects is one popular topic; spatial association patterns is another.

However, even with the recent attention, there are still many unexplored areas in moving objects research.  Specifically, higher semantic level problems remain mostly untouched.  One example is anomaly detection.  With the ever-increasing focus on video surveillance, many cities are tracking and analyzing vehicles as they move throughout the city.  With the ultimate goal of automated reporting and alerting, sophisticated algorithms are needed to evaluate the moving object trajectories.  Furthermore, associations with other multi-dimensional features will need to be considered as well.  Another example is periodic traffic pattern detection.  Everyone is familiar with rush hour traffic in big cities, but extracting and representing them in an efficient and concise manner has not been addressed.

To this end, we present our studies in this thesis.  With regards to anomaly detection, we present three models to automatically detect moving object anomaly, traffic anomaly, and subspace anomaly.  The last of which detects anomalies in a multidimensional space, which is often the case in real world datasets.  Additionally, we also address problems that could occur due to sampling in a multidimensional space and how to summarize moving object trajectories for more efficient processing.
